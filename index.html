                Paragliding is an exhilarating aerial sport where pilots fly lightweight, foot-launched gliders with fabric wings. The glider's shape is maintained by the suspension lines, air pressure, and the pilot's body weight. Paragliders can launch from hills or cliffs and use thermal currents to gain altitude and travel long distances. The sport offers a unique perspective of the landscape, blending the thrill of flying with the serenity of gliding silently through the air.
